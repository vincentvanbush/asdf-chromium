# asdf-chromium

[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) plugin for [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) version manager.

Currently at a very early development stage, only Linux x64 is supported.

## Why?

Did the same to [Firefox](https://github.com/vincentvanbush/asdf-firefox.git), so I thought... why not go for it with Chromium. It's a bit more tricky to download specific version's binary builds, but the results are promising!

## Install

```
asdf plugin-add chromium https://github.com/vincentvanbush/asdf-chromium.git
```

### Requirements

At this stage, only Linux is supported. Apart from that, you're good to go as soon as you've installed the `asdf` version manager.
